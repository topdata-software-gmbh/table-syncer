# Table Syncer View Feature Implementation Checklist

## 1. Modify TableSyncConfigDTO
- [ ] Add new properties:
  - `viewDefinition: ?string`
  - `shouldCreateView: bool` (default: false)
  - `viewDependencies: string[]`
- [ ] Update constructor to include new parameters
- [ ] Add validation in constructor:
  - If `shouldCreateView` is true, `viewDefinition` must not be empty
  - If `shouldCreateView` is true, `sourceTableName` must be set (as it will be the view name)

## 2. Update GenericTableSyncer
- [ ] Add `createSourceView` private method to handle view creation
- [ ] Modify `sync` method to call `createSourceView` at the beginning
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and logging for view creation

## 3. Implement View Creation Logic
- [ ] Process view dependencies before creating main view
- [ ] Execute each dependency SQL statement in sequence
- [ ] Create/Replace the main view using the provided SQL definition
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging for each step

## 4. Error Handling
- [ ] Handle database errors during view creation
- [ ] Provide meaningful error messages
- [ ] Ensure proper cleanup on failure

## 5. Logging
- [ ] Add debug logs for view creation process
- [ ] Log SQL execution results
- [ ] Log any warnings or errors encountered

## 6. Documentation
- [ ] Update class documentation for modified methods
- [ ] Add usage examples in the documentation
- [ ] Document the new configuration options

## 7. Testing
- [ ] Test with a simple view definition
- [ ] Test with view dependencies
- [ ] Test error scenarios (invalid SQL, missing dependencies, etc.)
- [ ] Test with existing table syncer functionality to ensure no regressions

## 8. Migration
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility
- [ ] Document any required changes for existing configurations

## 9. Code Review
- [ ] Review for coding standards compliance
- [ ] Verify error handling is robust
- [ ] Ensure logging is comprehensive but not excessive

## 10. Deployment
- [ ] Plan for deployment
- [ ] Prepare rollback strategy
- [ ] Document any special considerations for deployment

## Implementation Notes
- The `sourceTableName` in the configuration will be used as the view name when `shouldCreateView` is true
- View creation happens before any table synchronization begins
- All view operations are performed on the source connection
- The feature is opt-in (disabled by default) to maintain backward compatibility
